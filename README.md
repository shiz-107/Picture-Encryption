# Picture-Encryption
Picture encryption using S-boxes in Python is a crucial technique in cryptography for securing image data. S-boxes (substitution boxes) provide non-linear transformations that enhance the confusion property, making it difficult for attackers to correlate the input and output. By applying S-box transformations pixel by pixel or in blocks, image encryption achieves strong resistance to attacks like differential and linear cryptanalysis. This method ensures the image's confidentiality and integrity, making it ideal for secure communication and storage of sensitive visual data.
